Game will be like gun bros. A character moves around the map with wasd

======Game Mechanics ===============

character shoots in the direction of the cursor when left clicking
character has a follower, an archer
follower tails character and shoots at nearest enemy
follower + characters shall collectively be known as the 'heroes'

Character shoots arrows, but can attack surrounding enemies with his
vayrian steel sword

======================Enemies==============================================

There are two kinds of enemies based on attack: one is a melee attacker and the other is a ranged attacker
the ramged attackers shoot bullets that move in a slow motion, at least one every 3 seconds
The melee attackers have to be close to the heroes to attack
There are two kinds of enemies categorized by movement type: There are flying enemies and walking enemies
Walking enemies cannot pass through unpassable terrain
flying enemies can pass through unpassable terrain. All flying enemies are melee attackers except the dragon wight

Enemies consist of white walkers and their wights.

White Walkers:
    Ranged attackers, They are the enemies you have to clear per 10 levels.
    Walking type enemies
    Ranged attackers whose attacks have the following effects:

        100% chance to slow you 50%
        Inability to sprint
        40% chance to FEAR you
    Spawns wights every 25% of their health
    All their weights die if they die.

Wights:
    Undead monsters
    Fast like yeah. Around as fast as the player character
    Main enemies
    Really squishy
    Can fly (Dragon wights and others like gryffin wights)
Wight walkers:
    Resurrected dead humans
    Different from white walkers
    Runs fast like yeah
    melee attackers
    little bit less squishy
    Weakest damage dealt

Wight archers
    Resurrected dead humans
    Little slower than wight walkers
    most squishy wights
    ranged attackers but slow projectiles
    1 for every 3 walkers
    Attacks hurt more than walker attacks
Wight Bear
    2x2 tiles taken
    Really tanky
    walk
    strong attacks
    slowest wight
    Regenerates health
    Just ignore this wight when being overwhelmed.
Wight Dragon
    Spawned by the night king. At higher levels, there's always at least one of this at any given time.
    Icy burn attack (parang sa dry ice lang) slows your hero
    really tanky, tankier than regular white walkers
    Only fire breath is ranged. Else, attacks with melee
    quite fast but by that time, you have really good upgrades to help you against this monster
    melee attack is strong
    3x3 monster

Night king
    Spawns white walkers and wights
    Only white walker to spawn the wight dragon
    THe only enemy in the last level
    Faster than regular white walker, can sprint for a short time

    But is a melee attacker. He just spawns a lot of guys
    Really tanky

    Can freeze you with or without getting projectiles to hit you



Enemies follow character but can also attack the follower depending on which one is closer.
the enemies deal 3-5 damage, and the hero has 150 health, regenerating 1 per second.
THe enemies spawn in every 20 seconds in groups of 2-3

The character has to survive 2 minutes to go to the next level.
Every 10 levels, there will be a map change.

==================Tiles======================================================================

The game is tile based. Some tiles represent grass, water, rocks, flowers, and other stuff. More on this later.
Some tiles are collidable only by walking mobs, some are collidable by only flying, some are collidable by both.


=======================Technical Specifications=========================================

Map data shall be piped from a text file
There are initially two types of terrain: unpassable and passable
Walking enemies will find the shortest path towards the character

There will be no game layout manager. I will use absolute layouting
Screen dimensions shall be 1024*768
Runescape style UI.
